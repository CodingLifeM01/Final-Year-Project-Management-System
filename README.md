# Final Year Project Management System
This is my final year project for the Diploma in Computer Science course. This project is only for browse and will not have any updates.

This system allows the students to store and manage their Final Year Projects (FYP) in Nilai University, and it is containing few features such as file storage system, 
notification system, profile system, approve system, title registration system, comment system and so-on.
